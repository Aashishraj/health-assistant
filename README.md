Detect disease at intimate places of the human body.
A software which detects skin diseases by taking pictures of areas of skin and symptoms.
You can either create your profile 
or
you can run it in the intimate mode which secures your private information and photos.

We are making an app for this which will provide you the facility to :
  Know the disease, 
  Cure the disease on your own by using homemade solutions (if itâ€™s not too serious),
  Connect to doctor of relevant field who is a specialist of curing that type of disease,
  Scanning prescription and reminding when to take medicines,
  Reminding to upload the status that how much it is cured,
  Reminding when to take appointment for recheckup.

Any of these features can be used as an individual component.

All these things can be done in two modes:
  User Login and Signup mode.
  Intimate mode (where none of your data will be saved)
